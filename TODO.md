Let's enable a new feature called "Gallery" which will go into a full screen mode and expose a bottom dock to control the gallery which allows the user to show a gallery mode of all items, group items, or selected items, and make custom animation transitions between them or even to show multiple items at once in a flush grid or with a custom gap, flex flow, carousel, etc.

AUDIT:

common interface, good coding practice, allow for future media content like videos, PDFs, code, audio, animated GIFs, etc.
